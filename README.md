# express.challenge

This is the #10 express.js challenge. This is a work in progress that I have to re-visit. I have laid out the code needed to begin and created this repo to show that I am able to use GitHub and properly setup a workspace with proper file/folder setup and order, creating multiple branches, the main to have a published peice, develop to have a branch to work out of to which other branches will pull and push theyre changed/updated work to. Having a published site in general is necessary knowledge. I have fallen behind but in this challenge is where i commit to turning it around and will have resubmitted a complete and functional peice which I am currently in the process of writing, I just have yet to commit the work and merge it to the main branch due to it not being functional.
